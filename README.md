# About it
This is PC assistant which called Jarvis. It can do simple commands, like: open google/youtube/VS Code, create web workspace ect. 

To write it, I used Python and some libs which I wrote below. 
It works quite simply. it requires two neural networks "pvporcupine" and "gpt"

A __GPT__ model is using for answers on different questions like: "How many people in Ukraine?" or "How to write clean code?".
__pvporcupine__ used to voice GPT answers.
